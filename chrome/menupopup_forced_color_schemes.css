/* This only works on Windows10 when the proton-style context menus are used.
 * Purpose of this style is to force either dark or light version of menus
 * regardless of the Firefox theme you have.
 * This does NOTHING unless you go to about:config and create a new boolean pref
 * "userchrome.menupopups.force-light" (or "-dark" for dark version) and set it true.
 *
 * If both are set true then dark version is used.
 * If both are set false then normal Firefox behavior is used (so your theme selects it)
 * Changes to the prefs WON'T APPLY before Firefox is restarted.
